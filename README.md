# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Install Node.js and npm:

If you haven't already, install Node.js and npm from the official Node.js website.

## Create a new React project:

Use Create React App to set up a new React project with TypeScript. Open your terminal and run:

npx create-react-app simple-code-editor --template typescript

## Navigate to the project directory:

cd simple-code-editor

## Install required dependencies:

npm install prismjs prism-react-renderer

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
